                I currently work as a Data and Analytics Solutions Specialist for <a href="https://altronkarabina.com/">Altron Karabina</a>. 
                This involves understanding where the client currently is in their data and analytics journey, 
                where they want to go and figuring out how to get them there.

            <p>
                This entails carrying out Proofs of Concepts using Microsoft technologies such as <b>Power BI, SQL databases</b> (both on-premesis and
                on the Azure platform), data analytics using <b>DAX</b> and data engineering using <b>Python</b>. Designed a virtual assistant PoC to record 
                and take minutes in Teams meetings. The video can be found 
                <a href="https://youtu.be/EoYpTRagdDo"> here</a> 
                <p>I currently have 4 years' experience in this space.</p>
            </p> <p> </p>

            <p>
                Together with my brother, we started a company called Safire Engineering where we designed and built a <b>motion racing simulator</b>.
                This provides a realistic feel of a racing car's handling while driving around a circuit. A link to the video can be found

            <p>
                Designed and manufactured a six-component wind tunnel platform balance using optical fibre strain gauges sensors. The research was
                selected to be presented at the International Symposium of Strain Gauge Balances in 2016. The research absracts can be found

            <p>
                I worked as a maintenance engineer for <a href="http://www.polyoakpackaging.co.za/">Polyoak Packaging</a>, where I looked after the equipment that delivers compressed air and
                chilled water to the blow moulding machines. The number of breakdowns of the equipment was significantly reduced after having taken 
                over. I was also involved in the design, layout and commissioning of equipment of a new factory in Zimbabwe.
